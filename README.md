Hi! This is a simple image generator written with python pillow!🎨\
There are 148^2 variants of generated images!

Attention, there are old versions of images in generated directory, now I decided to deploy a version in the names of colors are not separated(E.X dark golden rod -> DarkGoldenRod), I think it looks better, but if you need an old version, look for regular expressions!
